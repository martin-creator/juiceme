# Gatsby Project

This project was created using Gatsby, a static site generator based on React. It includes the following features:

- Blazing-fast performance thanks to the use of pre-rendering and server-side rendering
- A powerful and flexible plugin architecture that allows for easy customization and extensibility
- Built-in support for modern web technologies like GraphQL, React, and CSS-in-JS

## Getting Started

1. To get started with this project, simply clone the repository and install the dependencies:
``` 
git clone https://github.com/your-username/gatsby-project.git
cd gatsby-project
npm install
```


2. Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running:
```
npm run develop
```


This will start a local development server at http://localhost:8000, where you can view the site and make changes.

## Building and Deploying

To build the site for production, run:

```
npm run build
```

This will generate a static site in the `public` directory. You can then deploy this site to any static hosting service, such as Netlify or GitHub Pages.
