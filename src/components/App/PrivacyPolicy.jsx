            It is Juiceme Inc policy to respect your privacy regarding any
            information we may collect while operating our website. This Privacy
            Policy applies to juiceme.io/ (hereinafter, "us", "we", or
            "www.juiceme.io/"). We respect your privacy and are committed to
            protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us
            through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy
            Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our
            Website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances
            we may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy
            Policy applies only to information we collect through the Website
            and does not apply to our collection of information from other

          </p>
          <p>
            This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms of service posted on
            our Website, set forth the general rules and policies governing your
            use of our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our

          <h4>WEBSITE VISITORS</h4>
          <p>
            Like most website operators, Juiceme collects
            non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers
            and servers typically make available, such as the browser type,
            language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each
            visitor request. Juiceme’s purpose in collecting non-personally
            identifying information is to better understand how Juiceme’s
            visitors use its website. From time to time, Juiceme may release
            non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
            publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website
          </p>

          <p>
            Juiceme also collects potentially personally-identifying information
            like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for
            users leaving comments on{" "}
            <a href="https://juiceme.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer ">
              https://juiceme.io/
            </a>
            blog posts. Juiceme only discloses logged in user and commenter IP
            addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
            personally-identifying information as described below.

          <h4>PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION</h4>
          <p>
            Certain visitors to Juiceme websites choose to interact with Juiceme
            in ways that require Juiceme to gather personally-identifying
            information. The amount and type of information that Juiceme gathers
            depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask
            visitors who leave a comment at https://juiceme.io/ to provide a
            username and email address.

            The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but
            remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method
            of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use
            commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information,
            we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

            Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by
            advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the
            ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an
            online advertisement to compile information about you or others who
            use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among
            other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will
            be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of
            cookies by Juiceme and does not cover the use of cookies by any

          <p>
            Juiceme uses the remarketing services to advertise on third party
            websites (including Google) to previous visitors to our site. It
            could mean that we advertise to previous visitors who haven't
            completed a task on our site, for example using the contact form to
            make an enquiry. This could be in the form of an advertisement on
            the Google search results page, or a site in the Google Display
            Network. Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve
            ads based on someone's past visits. Of course, any data collected
            will be used in accordance with our own privacy policy and Google's
            privacy policy.

          <p>
            You can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the
            Google Ad Preferences page, and if you want to you can opt out of
            interest-based advertising entirely by cookie settings or
            permanently using a browser plugin.

            personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only
            in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental
